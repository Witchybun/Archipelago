#  check 1309, and so on.  There's likely an in-game method for it.  However, we should have two checks.  One, if a duplicate special item is given, so
#  it is skipped being given entirely, and, if the inventory is full, find the first slot in inventory which is "junk" and get rid of it.  Its mean but
#  it'll work.  Another solution is to "reserve" a number of slots.  In the worst case, ~24 items would need to be reserved, reducing the "junk" slots to 18.
