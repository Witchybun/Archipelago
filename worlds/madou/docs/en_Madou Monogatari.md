# Madou Monogatari

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What initial changes from the vanilla game should I expect?
Most changes (other than item/location pairing) are either quality of life, or to avoid a 
softlock.  These include:
- The game starts immediately after the introduction (after you speak with grandma and go to bed).
- The frogs intro is skipped, and the jumping puzzle is skipped as its dumb.
- Frog King does not take away your boots if Sukiyapodes is not defeated.
- Harpy intro is skipped, so the player's stones are not taken.
- Suketoudora event where they are in their house is immediate, no need to go to Ruins Town.
- Scorpion is placed in their boat immediately, in Ruins Town et al.
- The explosion that opens up the North-South cave is an item.
- Headmaster is possessed immediately, and will not be un-possessed for continual entries to the maze.
- Upon clearing Building Block Maze, you are given the Dictionary.
- Picking incorrectly in Ancient Village doesn't impact you, so you can get everything.

## What is considered a location check in Madou Monogatari
- Opening chests,
- Learning spells (this can include the spells Arle starts with),
- Being given quest items,
- Secret stones,
- The rotten cucumbers in Shady Well,
- Walking into areas that include a Squirrel Station, if the setting is on,
- Running into enemies, if Bestiary is on.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?
Currently there is no notification that you will receive it, and items are only received in a non-paused state, 
which includes:
- In menu,
- In dialogue,
- In combat,
- At the main menu.

## What is the goal of Madou Monogatari?
The main goal of the game is obtaining enough Secret Stones, obtaining the Final Exam Certificate, 
climbing Magical Tower and defeating Devil.  Other goals include:
- Simply opening the final exam certificate, skipping the final trials.
- Giving your mother every souvenir.
- Opening the door to the library secret, requiring every gem.

## Why is Sukiyapodes' room corrupted?
Either a vanilla issue, or an issue with the translation.
